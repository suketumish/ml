# Iris Dataset Visualization

This project contains visualizations of the **classic Iris dataset**, which is commonly used for data analysis and machine learning. The project uses **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to explore, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset was first introduced by **R.A. Fisher (1936)** and is available on the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.  
It contains **150 samples** of iris flowers divided into three species:

- Iris-setosa  
- Iris-versicolor  
- Iris-virginica  

Each sample has **4 features**:

1. `SepalLengthCm` – Sepal length in cm  
2. `SepalWidthCm` – Sepal width in cm  
3. `PetalLengthCm` – Petal length in cm  
4. `PetalWidthCm` – Petal width in cm  

The dataset also contains an `Id` column for unique identifiers.
